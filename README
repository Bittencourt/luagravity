Introduction
============

LuaGravity is a reactive language that implements the synchronous approach for 
concurrency.
It is roughly based on Esterel and FrTime, two synchronous languages, the 
former having an imperative style, the latter being functional.

Documentation
=============

Documentation can be found on `doc/index.html`.

Installation
============

The distribution contains the core language, the meta module and also the 
DirectFB environment.
The `meta` module requires the LuaCoco[1] patch for Lua.
You need also the Lua binding to DirectFB[2] if you want to run some examples.

Then unpack LuaGravity to somewhere in your LUA_PATH:

    # cd /somewhere_in_lua_path
    # tar xvzf luagravity-0.5.1.tgz
    # mv luagravity-0.5.1/ luagravity/

    # cd luagravity/tests
    # make

Requires DirectFB:

    # cd ../examples
    # lua sky.lua
    # lua walker.lua
    # lua game.lua
